        Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that focuses
        on artificial intelligence,[10] search engine, online advertising, cloud
        computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and
        consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful
        company in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to
        its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in
        the area of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] It is considered one of
        the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside
        Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla. Google was founded on
        September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD
        students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about
        14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the stockholder
        voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an
        initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized
        as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's
        largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet
        properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on
        October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.
        On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14] The
        company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and
        services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market
        positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including
        email (Gmail), navigation (Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing
        (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating
        systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation
        (Translate), photo storage (Photo), video calling (Meet), smart home
        (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Fitbit), gaming
        (Stadia), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (TV),
        artificial intelligence (Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow),
        AI chips (TPU), and more. The company is also notorious for its vast
        portfolio of discontinued or replaced products,[15][16] which includes
        Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.
        Google is well-known for it highly ambitious technological innovations
        aimed at solving humanity's biggest problems.[17] Some of these
        innovations include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars
        (Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving project), smart cities
        (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Brain).
